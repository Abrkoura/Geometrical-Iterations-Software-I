# Geometrical-Iterations-Software-I
Geometrical Iterations is a Software project of IAAC, Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia developed at Master in Robotics and Advanced Construction in 2019

From a low poly mesh we create a morphological catalogue. Using the control points, we created small variations to see how the shape changes after the successives Catmull clark iterations.
In this example we can observe that a minimal change introduced in the geometry, generates an important change after one or two subdivisions. 
This phenomenon we can use in our final model to introduce variations in the shape with minimal changes over the basic geometry
Using the same low poly component, we introduced minimal changes in the mesh to experiment the changes after the successive iterations.

Requirements: 

1.Rhino 6 or above

2.Weavebird grasshopper plugin

Getting Started: 

1.Mesh divide by catmull clark

2.Creat twisted box for each surface

3.Add component to Box morph

4.Generat surface aggregations
